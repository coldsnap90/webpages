         <p> The joke may be hard to get staring at this meme, it alludes to two things. One is a sarcastic insult, which is mocking someone who doesnt understand internet sub-culture, which is a joke itself. The second is a joke from The Simpsons, Homer sets up an "internet" business, where he takes phone calls. </p>
